### Actively pursuing a SWE Internship for Summer 22'
### Open to relocation ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
<br />

I am a fast learner and I have strong fundamentals in Computer Science, which enables me to adapt to new programming languages and frameworks with ease. I am passionate about all things Software Development, Automation and Applied Machine Learning and I constantly strive to push myself out of my comfort zone to learn new concepts and acquire new skills. The breadth of the coursework I have taken as part of my Undergraduate and Graduate study ranges from Algorithms and Data Structures to Automated Learning and Data Analysis which has given me diverse perspectives while solving problems. My internship and hackathons that I have attended and won have given me a taste of working on projects in the software industry. I hope to collaborate, learn and augment my already existing skill set even further in my time as a Summer Intern.

ðŸ’¬ I love all things music related - RnB, Hip-Hop, Alternate, Indie and Hindustani Fusion.
<br />
ðŸŒ± My fav artists are alt-J, Mac Miller, Kendrick Lamar, Holly Humberstone.
